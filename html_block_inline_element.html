    <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available</p>
    <p>An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary</p>
    <p>The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements</p>
        <p>The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document</p>
